# Gym SQL Database

Relational SQL database that keeps track of a gym and it's components within a gym.
This data base includes tables for client members, staff members (and personal trainers), multiple floors, equipments, fitness sessions, timestamps, and other constraints that make up a classic gym!

The aim of this database was to help keep track of resources and allow for a gym to be efficiently ran as a business.

## Technologies Used:

### SQL Database including Java connectivity using JDBC

Database connection handler and setup was made using Oracle JDBC. This handled all SQL queries, mutations and deletions from the frontend to the backend.

### Java Swing UI

The frontend was made using Java Swing in order to utilize prioritize Oracle JDBC use case. We wanted to learn this technology and opted to use Java Swing for simplicity instead of other Javascript frontend frameworks such as React or Vue.js.
